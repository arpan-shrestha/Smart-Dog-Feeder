🐶📡 Smart Stray Dog Feeder – An IoT Solution for Animal Welfare in Nepal
Stray dogs in Nepal often struggle to find food, leading to poor health and hunger. To address this, we developed a Smart Dog Feeder—an automated IoT-based system that detects stray dogs and dispenses food when needed.
🔹 How It Works:
✅ Ultrasonic Sensor detects movement.
✅ Camera captures the image and YOLOv8 AI identifies if it’s a dog.
✅ If a dog is detected, food is dispensed automatically.
✅ GPS tracks the feeder’s location.
✅ GSM sends alerts when food is low.
🔹 Key Benefits:
📲 Real-time Monitoring for animal welfare groups.
⏳ Saves time & reduces manual effort.
📊 Smart Data Collection to optimize feeding schedules.
💸 Cost-effective & Scalable for multiple locations.
Combining Raspberry Pi, Image Processing, GSM, GPS, and IoT, this solution supports animal welfare groups like Shena Care in feeding stray dogs more efficiently.
