# Smart Dog Feeder
🐶📡 Smart Dog Feeder – An IoT Solution for Animal Welfare in Nepal
Stray dogs in Nepal often struggle to find food, leading to poor health and hunger. To address this, we developed a Smart Dog Feeder—an automated IoT-based system that detects stray dogs and dispenses food when needed. <br/>
<br/>
🔹 How It Works:<br/>
✅ Ultrasonic Sensor detects movement.<br/>
✅ Camera captures the image and YOLOv8 AI identifies if it’s a dog.<br/>
✅ If a dog is detected, food is dispensed automatically.<br/>
✅ GPS tracks the feeder’s location.<br/>
✅ GSM sends alerts when food is low.<br/>
🔹 Key Benefits:<br/>
📲 Real-time Monitoring for animal welfare groups.<br/>
⏳ Saves time & reduces manual effort.<br/>
📊 Smart Data Collection to optimize feeding schedules.<br/>
💸 Cost-effective & Scalable for multiple locations.<br/>
<br/>
Combining Raspberry Pi, Image Processing, GSM, GPS, and IoT, this solution supports animal welfare groups like Shena Care in feeding stray dogs more efficiently.
